# insitu

An instrumentation and testing library.  

An in situ test runs online within the application alongside logging, metrics and other instrumentation.  An in vitro test is run offline.  It can be a unit test or integration test.

Tests are expected to be triggered repeatedly.  The framework collects metrics over an ensemble of test runs.

# Status

Currently this is being rewritten to use scala 3 metaprogramming.
